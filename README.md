# Vue-Udemy
The Vue.js course from Udemy - The Complete Guide (with Router, Vuex, Composition API).

Lesson 5 (Section 1 of the course):
    * starts the first pratical exercise in which we create an
    app using only JS.

Lesson 6 (Section 1):
    * re-building the previous app with Vue.

Lesson 13-15 (Section 2):
    * class 13 - creating and connecting Vue App instances;
    * class 14 - interpolation and data binging;
    * class 15 - binding attributes with the `v-bind` directive.

Lesson 16 (Section 2):
    * added a bit dynamism to the app (whenever it is reloaded, randomly changes the text content);
    * understanding "methods" in Vue apps.

Lesson 17 (Section 2):
    * working with data inside of a Vue app.

Lesson 18 (Section 2):
    * outputting raw HTML content with `v-html`;
    * not needed to often, and should not be used as a default because we can introduce security issues because we basically circumvent the built in cross site scripting attack protection we have with the double curly braces.

Assignment section 2:
    * put in practice what was learned so far (data binding).

Lesson 20:
    * listening to user events;
    * the `v-on` directive;
    * understanding event binding.

Lesson 21:
    * events and methods;
    * code from previous exercise reorganitation (all logic code into JS).

Lesson 22:
    * working with event arguments by passing them to methods.

Lesson 23:
    * using the native `event` object;
    * `event` as an argument;
    * update of a property (name, in this case) whenever it is typed in the `input` field which will be outputed in our paragraph.
